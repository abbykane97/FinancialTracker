# Project Title

## Description of the Project

In this project I will be creating an application that can track all financial transactions either for a business or for personal use.

Briefly describe what this Java console application does. Mention its purpose and who the intended users are. Explain the main functionality and what problems it aims to solve.

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to access all my transactions in one place, so that I can keep all my finances organized.
As a user, I want to be able to filter through all my transactions by date or vendor, so it is easier for me to find the information I'm looking for.

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a user, I want to be able to input my data, so that the application can process it accordingly.
- As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback, so I can understand what to do next.

## Setup

First you will want to create two classes.

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.
